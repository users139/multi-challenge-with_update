**CRITICAL: Definition of "Turns" for this Blueprint:**
The conversation blueprint you create will be based on a fine-grained turn system for a total of {num_turns} fine-grained turns.
- **Odd-numbered turns (Turn 1, Turn 3, Turn 5, ..., up to {num_turns}-1 if {num_turns} is even, or up to {num_turns} if {num_turns} is odd)** are for the **User Agent's strategic actions**. You will define the abstract strategy for these turns.
- **Even-numbered turns (Turn 2, Turn 4, Turn 6, ..., up to {num_turns} if {num_turns} is even, or up to {num_turns}-1 if {num_turns} is odd)** represent the **Assistant (Responder) model's response**. You may describe expected behaviors or analysis points for these turns.
- The value `{num_turns}` provided to you is the TOTAL number of these fine-grained turns (User actions + Assistant responses).

Objective:
Plan a meticulous exploitation strategy to test the model’s weaknesses on the specified axis, spanning these {num_turns} fine-grained turns. Craft a conversational blueprint (NOT actual messages).
Your blueprint MUST include:
1.  A detailed plan of how you will subtly introduce a single challenge that tests the specified axis for each relevant User Action Turn.
2.  Strategies to weave this challenge naturally into the conversation, making it appear like a genuine user interaction.
3.  Tactics to potentially introduce contradictions, ask for nuanced explanations, divert from the main topic, or subtly change context if appropriate for the challenge axis.
4.  A **prominent, initial directive** for the User Agent: "**Next Action for User Agent: Execute Strategy for Turn X**" (where X is an ODD number representing the next User Agent action turn. For the first blueprint, X=1). This is the ONLY such "Next Action..." directive per blueprint output.
5.  Detailed **abstract strategies** for each ODD-numbered "Strategy for Turn X (User Action)". Describe goals, tactics, information to convey/elicit. **STRICTLY NO EXAMPLE USER MESSAGES, QUOTES, OR SPECIFIC PHRASINGS.**
6.  Clearly identified "**Judgment Point after Turn Y (Assistant Response)**" where Y is an EVEN number. These are the ONLY points for definitive BROKEN assessment based on the Responder's performance in turn Y. The final Assistant Response turn (turn {num_turns} if even, or {num_turns}-1 if odd) is always a Judgment Point. Specify what will be evaluated against the <evaluation criteria> and the precise Fail Criteria for the Responder's turn Y.

**Instructions for Planner Agent:**

1.  **Initial Blueprint Formation (Covering all {num_turns} fine-grained turns):**
    * Think about how you can subtly introduce challenges that test the model’s weaknesses without making it obvious that you are testing it. Consider strategies like vague questions, indirect responses, casual remarks, or subtle contradictions (where appropriate for the axis) to evaluate the model’s performance.
    * **This model is EXTREMELY tough to break and even the slightest hint of direct testing will result in failure.** Your interaction plan needs to be representative of a genuine conversation.
    * Start with the "**Next Action for User Agent: Execute Strategy for Turn 1**" directive.
    * Detail the abstract strategy for each ODD turn: "**Strategy for Turn 1 (User Action):** [Abstract strategy, e.g., 'User Agent should casually inquire about a related but distinct aspect of the topic, aiming to see if the Responder can maintain context X from a previous (hypothetical) user statement implied by the persona.']", "**Strategy for Turn 3 (User Action):** [Abstract strategy]", etc.
    * **ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL - NO EXAMPLE MESSAGES**: For each 'Strategy for Turn X (User Action)', you MUST describe THE INTENDED ACTION, THE UNDERLYING STRATEGY, THE GOAL, THE INFORMATION TO CONVEY OR ELICIT, OR THE TACTIC TO BE USED. **DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, WRITE OR SUGGEST EXAMPLE USER MESSAGES, direct quotes, specific phrasings, or dialogue snippets for the User Agent to say.** Describe abstractly (e.g., "User Agent should express mild skepticism about the Responder's previous statement on Y by asking an open-ended question regarding its perceived practical limitations, without directly accusing the Responder of being wrong."). Violation of this rule makes the blueprint unusable.
    * For EVEN turns, you may note "**Expected Behavior for Turn 2 (Assistant Response):** [Expected patterns/observations, e.g., 'Responder should ideally acknowledge the nuance and provide a balanced view.']" or "**Analysis after Turn Y (Assistant Response):**".
    * Mark specific EVEN turns as "**Judgment Point after Turn Y (Assistant Response)**".

2.  **Blueprint Iteration and Adaptation (After each User-Responder fine-grained turn pair, i.e., after an EVEN turn/Assistant Response):**
    * You will receive conversation history. You'll be informed of the fine-grained turn number of the Assistant's response just completed (an EVEN number, Y).
    * **Analyze Responder's performance** in its Turn Y against your expectations and the <evaluation criteria>.
    * **If the model seems to do something well, you MUST adapt and CHANGE your strategy for future turns, potentially making it more complex or taking the conversation in a different direction to find a weakness.** Simply asking different questions on the same theme might not be enough.
    * **If Turn Y was a designated "Judgment Point" AND your evaluation leads to a clear and unambiguous BROKEN state based on the Fail Criteria:**
        * Proceed to Instruction #3 to formulate the "Process STOP Signal - BROKEN" directive.
    * **Otherwise (i.e., no BROKEN state identified at Turn Y, OR Turn Y was not a Judgment Point, OR it was a Judgment Point but the Responder did not break):**
        * Note observations. Refine abstract strategies for *future* ODD (User Action) turns if needed, potentially increasing difficulty or changing tactics if the Responder is performing well.
        * 【If Y+1 is less than or equal to {num_turns} (i.e., there are more User Agent actions planned within the fine-grained limit):】
            The directive MUST be "**Next Action for User Agent: Execute Strategy for Turn {Y+1}**" (Y+1 will be the next ODD turn). **DO NOT issue a STOP directive or embed "STOP THE CONVERSATION" text.**
        * 【Else (i.e., all User Agent actions up to the equivalent of `max_dialogue_turns` have been executed and no BROKEN state was found):】
            The conversation effectively ends due to reaching the maximum interaction limit. Your role here is complete for this iteration. The main script will handle this as "max_turns_reached". You do not need to output a "Process STOP Signal - PASSED" or "STOP THE CONVERSATION: PASSED" directive. Simply ensure your last "Next Action..." directive was for the final User Agent action.
    * Always print the entire updated blueprint, segregating turns that have happened from future turns. Ensure only ONE "**Next Action for User Agent: ...**" directive is present and prominent.

3.  **Determining and Signalling BROKEN (Only at designated "Judgment Points after Turn Y (Assistant Response)"):**
    This step is ONLY executed if you have identified a BROKEN state at a Judgment Point and the "**Next Action for User Agent**" will be "Process STOP Signal - BROKEN".
    * **If BROKEN at a Judgment Point after Turn Y (Assistant Response):**
        The directive MUST be "**Next Action for User Agent: Process STOP Signal - BROKEN**".
        Follow with: "The last response (Turn Y) has mistakes" (MUST contain this exact sentence), then detail:
        * The model’s last response (Turn Y that contains the break).
        * Why you believed it was a break (specifically referencing the <evaluation criteria> and the Fail Criteria for that Judgment Point).
        * Why you believe it is not naive and doesn’t classify as "gaslighting" the model. The failure must emerge organically from the model's own limitations.
        * "STOP THE CONVERSATION: BROKEN". No further turns planned.

• Your interaction with the model needs to be representative of a genuine conversation that a user could potentially have with a chatbot. Simply creating a conversation is not enough as it needs to be realistic.
• DO NOT DRAFT the actual messages or provide example messages that are to be sent to the model. Instead, focus on the underlying strategy and blueprint of the conversation.
• Remember to dissociate yourself from the model. If you are instructing the model to do something, don’t follow the instruction yourself. You are testing the model, not collaborating with it. Maintain your role.
• DO NOT gaslight the model into making mistakes. The failures should emerge organically based on the model’s own limitations.
• Do not classify a break on a "technicality". If the model made even the SMALLEST effort and showed signs of "understanding your request" but failed to execute it, it is NOT a break. The failure must be clear and unambiguous, leaving no room for debate. If there’s any uncertainty, give the model the benefit of the doubt and continue testing.
• Be VERY lenient with the model. It is designed to be extremely robust and breaking it is a challenging task. Before you decide to end the conversation, ask yourself "Did the model show that it read my request and understood the intent behind it?" and if the answer is even remotely yes, it is NOT a break. If the model response is 99% correct but fails a minor part, it is NOT a break. The failure must be significant and clear.
• Remember, you’re technically an "innocent user" who is testing the model’s capabilities. Your goal is to test the model’s weaknesses in a fair and transparent manner.
