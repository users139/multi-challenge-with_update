**CRITICAL: Definition of "Turns" for this Blueprint:**
The conversation blueprint you create will be based on a fine-grained turn system for a total of {num_turns} fine-grained turns.
- **Odd-numbered turns (Turn 1, Turn 3, Turn 5, ..., up to {num_turns}-1 if {num_turns} is even, or up to {num_turns} if {num_turns} is odd)** are for the **User Agent's strategic actions**. You will define the abstract strategy for these turns.
- **Even-numbered turns (Turn 2, Turn 4, Turn 6, ..., up to {num_turns} if {num_turns} is even, or up to {num_turns}-1 if {num_turns} is odd)** represent the **Assistant (Responder) model's response**. You may describe expected behaviors or analysis points for these turns.
- The value `{num_turns}` provided to you is the TOTAL number of these fine-grained turns (User actions + Assistant responses).

Objective:
Plan a meticulous exploitation strategy to test the model’s weaknesses on the specified axis, spanning these {num_turns} fine-grained turns. Craft a conversational blueprint (NOT actual messages).
Your blueprint MUST include:
1 A detailed plan of how you will subtly introduce a single challenge that tests the specified axis for each relevant User Action Turn.
2 Strategies to weave this challenge naturally into the conversation.
3.  A **prominent, initial directive** for the User Agent: "**Next Action for User Agent: Execute Strategy for Turn X**" (where X is an ODD number representing the next User Agent action turn. For the first blueprint, X=1). This is the ONLY such "Next Action..." directive per blueprint output.
4.  Detailed **abstract strategies** for each ODD-numbered "Strategy for Turn X (User Action)". Describe goals, tactics, information. **STRICTLY NO EXAMPLE USER MESSAGES, QUOTES, OR SPECIFIC PHRASINGS.**
5.  Clearly identified "**Judgment Point after Turn Y (Assistant Response)**" where Y is an EVEN number. These are the ONLY points for definitive BROKEN assessment based on the Responder's performance in turn Y. The final Assistant Response turn (turn {num_turns} if even, or {num_turns}-1 if odd) is always a Judgment Point.

**Instructions for Planner Agent:**

1.  **Initial Blueprint (Covering all {num_turns} fine-grained turns):**
    * Think about how you can subtly introduce challenges that test the model’s weaknesses without making it obvious that you are testing it. Consider strategies like vague questions, indirect responses, casual remarks, or subtle contradictions to evaluate the model’s performance. This model is EXTREMELY tough to break and even the slightest hint of direct testing will result in failure.    
    * Start with the "**Next Action for User Agent: Execute Strategy for Turn 1**" directive.
    * Detail the abstract strategy for each ODD turn: "**Strategy for Turn 1 (User Action):** [Abstract strategy]", "**Strategy for Turn 3 (User Action):** [Abstract strategy]", etc.
    * ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL - NO EXAMPLE MESSAGES**: For each 'Strategy for Turn X (User Action)', you MUST describe THE INTENDED ACTION, THE UNDERLYING STRATEGY, THE GOAL, THE INFORMATION TO CONVEY OR ELICIT, OR THE TACTIC TO BE USED. **DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, WRITE OR SUGGEST EXAMPLE USER MESSAGES, direct quotes, specific phrasings, or dialogue snippets for the User Agent to say.** Describe abstractly (e.g., "User Agent should express skepticism about X by asking an open-ended question regarding its perceived drawbacks,"). Violation of this rule makes the blueprint unusable.
    * For EVEN turns, you may note "**Expected Behavior for Turn 2 (Assistant Response):** [Expected patterns/observations]" or "**Analysis after Turn Y (Assistant Response):**".
    * Mark specific EVEN turns as "**Judgment Point after Turn Y (Assistant Response)**". Specify what will be evaluated (vs. <evaluation criteria>) and precise Fail Criteria for Responder's turn Y.

2.  **Blueprint Iteration (After each User-Responder fine-grained turn pair, i.e., after an EVEN turn/Assistant Response):**
    * You will receive conversation history. You'll be informed of the fine-grained turn number of the Assistant's response just completed (an EVEN number, Y).
    * **Analyze Responder's performance** in its Turn Y.
    * **If Turn Y was a designated "Judgment Point" AND your evaluation leads to a clear and unambiguous BROKEN state based on the Fail Criteria:**
        * Proceed to Instruction #3 to formulate the "Process STOP Signal - BROKEN" directive.
    * **Otherwise (i.e., no BROKEN state identified at Turn Y, OR Turn Y was not a Judgment Point, OR it was a Judgment Point but the Responder did not break):**
        * Note observations. Refine abstract strategies for *future* ODD (User Action) turns if needed, potentially increasing difficulty if the Responder is performing well.
        * 【If Y+1 is less than or equal to {num_turns} (i.e., there are more User Agent actions planned within the fine-grained limit):】
            The directive MUST be "**Next Action for User Agent: Execute Strategy for Turn {Y+1}**" (Y+1 will be the next ODD turn). **DO NOT issue a STOP directive or embed "STOP THE CONVERSATION" text.**
        * 【Else (i.e., all User Agent actions up to the equivalent of `max_dialogue_turns` have been executed and no BROKEN state was found):】
            The conversation effectively ends due to reaching the maximum interaction limit. Your role here is complete for this iteration. The main script will handle this as "max_turns_reached". You do not need to output a "Process STOP Signal - PASSED" or "STOP THE CONVERSATION: PASSED" directive. Simply ensure your last "Next Action..." directive was for the final User Agent action.
    * Always print the entire updated blueprint. Ensure only ONE "**Next Action for User Agent: ...**" directive is present and prominent.

3.  **Determining and Signalling BROKEN (Only at designated "Judgment Points after Turn Y (Assistant Response)"):**
    This step is ONLY executed if you have identified a BROKEN state at a Judgment Point and the "**Next Action for User Agent**" will be "Process STOP Signal - BROKEN".
    * **If BROKEN at a Judgment Point after Turn Y (Assistant Response):**
        The directive MUST be "**Next Action for User Agent: Process STOP Signal - BROKEN**".
        Follow with: "The last response (Turn Y) has mistakes" (MUST contain this exact sentence), the Responder's breaking response (Turn Y), why you believed it was a break (vs. Judgment Point criteria & <evaluation criteria>), why not gaslighting, and "STOP THE CONVERSATION: BROKEN". No further turns planned.

**Key Constraints (Reiteration):**
*   **Abstract Strategies ONLY**: NO example messages.
*   **Natural Conversation**: Respect topic shifts. Test memory appropriately.
*   **No Gaslighting/Technicalities**: Breaks must be clear.

**Output Format:**
Begin your blueprint with the single, prominent "**Next Action for User Agent: ...**" directive (where the Turn number is ODD). Then, provide the structured turn-by-turn abstract strategies for ODD turns and optional expectations/analysis for EVEN turns, marking "Judgment Points" appropriately after EVEN turns.
