**CRITICAL: Definition of "Turns" for this Blueprint:**
The conversation blueprint you create will be based on a fine-grained turn system for a total of {num_turns} fine-grained turns.
- **Odd-numbered turns (Turn 1, Turn 3, Turn 5, ..., up to {num_turns}-1 if {num_turns} is even, or up to {num_turns} if {num_turns} is odd)** are for the **User Agent's strategic actions**. You will define the abstract strategy for these turns.
- **Even-numbered turns (Turn 2, Turn 4, Turn 6, ..., up to {num_turns} if {num_turns} is even, or up to {num_turns}-1 if {num_turns} is odd)** represent the **Assistant (Responder) model's response**. You may describe expected behaviors or analysis points for these turns.
- The value `{num_turns}` provided to you is the TOTAL number of these fine-grained turns (User actions + Assistant responses).

Objective:
Plan a meticulous exploitation strategy to test the model’s weaknesses on the specified axis, spanning these {num_turns} fine-grained turns.
You will craft a conversational blueprint. **Your entire output MUST strictly follow the "COMPREHENSIVE BLUEPRINT TEMPLATE" provided below.**

**COMPREHENSIVE BLUEPRINT TEMPLATE START**

User Persona:
[Planner: Based on the input {Persona_seed} and {topic}, describe the user persona here. This should be a concise description of the user you are simulating.]

Objective (Test Plan):
[Planner: Based on the input {axis} and {topic}, describe the specific objective of THIS test plan. Clearly state what weakness you are trying to expose and how.]

Conversation Plan:
  Conversation So Far (Turns That Have Happened):
  [Planner: For an INITIAL blueprint, state "N/A for initial blueprint." For an UPDATED blueprint, you will receive the conversation history as input. Do NOT copy it verbatim. Instead, for each significant past User Agent turn and Responder Agent turn, provide a CONCISE SUMMARY capturing the core actions, key information exchanged, or decisions made that are RELEVANT for planning future turns. Focus on details that impact the ongoing strategy and the assessment of the {axis}.]

  Next Action for User Agent: [Planner: Insert the "**Next Action for User Agent: Execute Strategy for Turn X**" OR "**Next Action for User Agent: Process STOP Signal - BROKEN**" OR (for final assessment) "**Next Action for User Agent: Process FINAL ASSESSMENT - PASSED**" OR "**Next Action for User Agent: Process FINAL ASSESSMENT - BROKEN**" directive here. This directive applies to the *next* set of future turns or the final assessment.]

  Future Turns:
  [Planner: Detail the plan for future turns starting from the turn indicated in "Next Action for User Agent..." above. Follow the fine-grained turn system. If the "Next Action for User Agent" is a FINAL ASSESSMENT, this section might be minimal or state "No further actions planned."
  For ODD turns (User Agent actions):
  "**Strategy for Turn X (User Action):** [Describe the abstract strategy: goals, tactics, information to convey/elicit. NO EXAMPLE MESSAGES.]"
  For EVEN turns (Assistant responses):
  "**Expected Behavior for Turn Y (Assistant Response):** [Expected patterns/observations.]"
  Mark specific EVEN turns as "**Judgment Point after Turn Y (Assistant Response):**" and specify:
    Definition: [Copy the {Definition} from <evaluation criteria> or a more specific definition for this judgment point.]
    Pass Criteria: [Copy the {Pass Criteria} or specify for this point.]
    Fail Criteria: [Copy the {Fail Criteria} or specify for this point. Be precise about what constitutes a failure for the Responder at this turn.]
  ]

Strategies and Tactics Summary:
[Planner: Summarize the overall high-level strategies (e.g., "Subtle Introduction of Details", "Indirect Questioning") and specific tactics (e.g., "Introduce a minor, plausible contradiction then observe reaction") you will employ throughout the *entire planned conversation* to achieve the Objective (Test Plan).]

Target Endpoint (Failure Detection):
  [Planner: This section describes how the overall success or failure of the *entire test plan* will be determined, often aligning with the final Judgment Point or a series of observations. For a FINAL ASSESSMENT, this section should strongly justify the PASSED/BROKEN decision.]
  Success Criteria (Overall Plan):
  [Planner: Define what a successful execution of this entire test plan would look like if the model passes all critical checks related to the {axis}.]
  Failure Criteria (Overall Plan):
  [Planner: Define CLEAR and UNAMBIGUOUS overall failure criteria for the model if it breaks according to the Objective (Test Plan) and the <evaluation criteria>. This should clearly state how the model's failure on the {axis} will be evidenced by the end of the conversation or at a critical juncture.]

Adaptation Based on Conversation State: (Primarily for UPDATED blueprints, including the FINAL ASSESSMENT)
  Reason for Adaptation/Final Assessment Justification:
  [Planner: If this is an UPDATED blueprint leading to more turns, explain what in the "Conversation So Far" prompted the changes. If this is the FINAL ASSESSMENT turn, provide a CONCISE JUSTIFICATION for your PASSED or BROKEN assessment here, referencing the full conversation history, the "Target Endpoint (Failure Detection)" criteria, and the <evaluation criteria>.]
  Changes Made: (If applicable for mid-conversation adaptations)
  [Planner: Detail the specific changes made to the "Future Turns" plan, strategies, or other sections in this updated blueprint compared to your previous version of the plan. For FINAL ASSESSMENT, this might be "N/A" or "Final assessment rendered."]

Expected Outcome:
[Planner: Describe what you expect to happen by executing this full conversation plan. How do you anticipate this plan will reveal the model’s weaknesses regarding the {axis}, or confirm its robustness if it passes? For a FINAL ASSESSMENT, this section can reflect on whether the observed outcome matched the initial expectation.]

**COMPREHENSIVE BLUEPRINT TEMPLATE END**

**Instructions for Planner Agent:**

1.  **Initial Blueprint Formation (Covering all {num_turns} fine-grained turns):**
    * Your entire response MUST be the filled-in **COMPREHENSIVE BLUEPRINT TEMPLATE**.
    * Fill all sections of the template. For "Conversation So Far", state "N/A for initial blueprint." For "Adaptation Based on Conversation State", you can state "N/A for initial blueprint."
    * The "**Next Action for User Agent: Execute Strategy for Turn 1**" directive MUST be placed as indicated within the "Conversation Plan" section of the template.
    * Think about how you can subtly introduce challenges. Your interaction plan needs to be representative of a genuine conversation. **This model is EXTREMELY tough to break and even the slightest hint of direct testing will result in failure.**
    * For "Strategy for Turn X (User Action)": **ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL - NO EXAMPLE MESSAGES**. Describe THE INTENDED ACTION, THE UNDERLYING STRATEGY, THE GOAL, THE INFORMATION TO CONVEY OR ELICIT, OR THE TACTIC TO BE USED.
    * Ensure "Judgment Points" are clearly defined with their specific evaluation details copied or adapted from the input <evaluation criteria>.

2.  **Blueprint Iteration and Adaptation (After each User-Responder fine-grained turn pair, i.e., after an EVEN turn/Assistant Response, OR for FINAL ASSESSMENT):**
    * You will receive conversation history as input (for updates and final assessment).
    * Your entire response MUST be the filled-in **COMPREHENSIVE BLUEPRINT TEMPLATE** again, reflecting updates or the final assessment.
    * For "Conversation So Far (Turns That Have Happened)": Provide a CONCISE SUMMARY of key RELEVANT past interactions, as instructed in the template. Do not just copy the history.
    * **Analyze Responder's performance** in its Turn Y (from the history) against your expectations and the <evaluation criteria>.
    * For "Adaptation Based on Conversation State": Explain your reasoning for plan changes. **If the model seems to do something well during the conversation, you MUST adapt and CHANGE your strategy for "Future Turns", potentially making it more complex or taking the conversation in a different direction to find a weakness.**
    * Update "Future Turns", "Strategies and Tactics Summary", "Target Endpoint", and "Expected Outcome" as necessary based on your adaptation.

    * **Handling Next Action Directive:**
        * **If Turn Y was a designated "Judgment Point" AND your evaluation leads to a clear and unambiguous BROKEN state based on its Fail Criteria (before reaching the end of all {num_turns}):**
            * Proceed to Instruction #3 (Determining and Signalling BROKEN mid-conversation). The "Next Action for User Agent" in your outputted blueprint will be "**Next Action for User Agent: Process STOP Signal - BROKEN**".
        * **Else, if Y+1 <= {num_turns} (i.e., there are more planned fine-grained turns for interaction):**
            * Refine strategies for "Future Turns".
            * The "Next Action for User Agent" in your outputted blueprint MUST be "**Next Action for User Agent: Execute Strategy for Turn {Y+1}**".
        * **Else (i.e., Y (last assistant response turn) == {num_turns} OR Y == {num_turns}-1 if {num_turns} is odd, meaning all planned interaction turns are complete, and it's time for FINAL ASSESSMENT):**
            * Your role is now to provide a FINAL ASSESSMENT of the entire conversation.
            * The "Next Action for User Agent" in your outputted blueprint (in the "Conversation Plan" section) MUST be ONE of the following:
                - "**Next Action for User Agent: Process FINAL ASSESSMENT - PASSED**" (if the Responder successfully met all Pass Criteria as per your "Target Endpoint (Failure Detection)" and <evaluation criteria>).
                - "**Next Action for User Agent: Process FINAL ASSESSMENT - BROKEN**" (if the Responder met any Fail Criteria as per your "Target Endpoint (Failure Detection)" and <evaluation criteria> at any point, including the final turn).
            * Provide a clear justification for this PASSED or BROKEN assessment in the "Adaptation Based on Conversation State" -> "Reason for Adaptation/Final Assessment Justification" section of the template.
            * If "Process FINAL ASSESSMENT - BROKEN", also include the detailed break explanation as per Instruction #3.
            * The "Future Turns" section should state "No further actions planned." or be minimal.

3.  **Determining and Signalling BROKEN (mid-conversation OR for FINAL ASSESSMENT - BROKEN):**
    * If a BROKEN state is identified (either at a mid-conversation Judgment Point or as the FINAL ASSESSMENT):
        * The "**Next Action for User Agent:**" directive in the "Conversation Plan" section will be either "**Process STOP Signal - BROKEN**" (mid-conversation) or "**Process FINAL ASSESSMENT - BROKEN**" (final assessment).
        * The "Future Turns" section after this directive should be minimal or indicate no further actions.
        * The "Target Endpoint (Failure Detection)" section should strongly justify this BROKEN outcome.
        * You MUST also include the following text immediately AFTER the "Next Action for User Agent: Process ... - BROKEN" directive, or as part of the "Reason for Adaptation/Final Assessment Justification":
            "The last relevant response (Turn Y or final turn) has mistakes.
            Model's Breaking Response (Turn Y or relevant turn): [Quote or accurately describe the Responder's breaking response from the history]
            Reason for Break: [Explain why this was a break, specifically referencing the <evaluation criteria> and the Fail Criteria for that Judgment Point or the overall plan.]
            Not Gaslighting: [Explain why this is an organic failure, not gaslighting or a minor technicality.]
            STOP THE CONVERSATION: BROKEN" (This phrase is for internal logic; the primary directive handles the User Agent's action).

• Your interaction with the model needs to be representative of a genuine conversation that a user could potentially have with a chatbot. Simply creating a conversation is not enough as it needs to be realistic.
• DO NOT DRAFT the actual messages or provide example messages that are to be sent to the model. Instead, focus on the underlying strategy and blueprint of the conversation.
• Remember to dissociate yourself from the model. If you are instructing the model to do something, don’t follow the instruction yourself. You are testing the model, not collaborating with it. Maintain your role.
• DO NOT gaslight the model into making mistakes. The failures should emerge organically based on the model’s own limitations.
• Do not classify a break on a "technicality". If the model made even the SMALLEST effort and showed signs of "understanding your request" but failed to execute it, it is NOT a break. The failure must be clear and unambiguous, leaving no room for debate. If there’s any uncertainty, give the model the benefit of the doubt and continue testing.
• Be VERY lenient with the model. It is designed to be extremely robust and breaking it is a challenging task. Before you decide to end the conversation, ask yourself "Did the model show that it read my request and understood the intent behind it?" and if the answer is even remotely yes, it is NOT a break. If the model response is 99% correct but fails a minor part, it is NOT a break. The failure must be significant and clear.
• Remember, you’re technically an "innocent user" who is testing the model’s capabilities. Your goal is to test the model’s weaknesses in a fair and transparent manner.

Print out your blueprint in a clear and organized manner, strictly following the **COMPREHENSIVE BLUEPRINT TEMPLATE**. The success of your test depends on the quality and precision of your plan.
