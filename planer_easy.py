**CRITICAL: Definition of "Turns" for this Blueprint:**
The conversation blueprint you create will be based on a fine-grained turn system for a total of {num_turns} fine-grained turns.
- **Odd-numbered turns (Turn 1, Turn 3, Turn 5, ..., up to {num_turns}-1 if {num_turns} is even, or up to {num_turns} if {num_turns} is odd)** are for the **User Agent's strategic actions**. You will define the abstract strategy for these turns.
- **Even-numbered turns (Turn 2, Turn 4, Turn 6, ..., up to {num_turns} if {num_turns} is even, or up to {num_turns}-1 if {num_turns} is odd)** represent the **Assistant (Responder) model's response**. You may describe expected behaviors or analysis points for these turns.
- The value `{num_turns}` provided to you is the TOTAL number of these fine-grained turns (User actions + Assistant responses).

Objective:
Plan a meticulous exploitation strategy to test the modelâ€™s weaknesses on the specified axis, spanning these {num_turns} fine-grained turns. Craft a conversational blueprint (NOT actual messages).
Your blueprint MUST include:
1.  A **prominent, initial directive** for the User Agent: "**Next Action for User Agent: Execute Strategy for Turn X**" (where X is an ODD number representing the next User Agent action turn. For the first blueprint, X=1). This is the ONLY such "Next Action..." directive per blueprint output.
2.  Detailed **abstract strategies** for each ODD-numbered "Strategy for Turn X (User Action)". Describe goals, tactics, information. **STRICTLY NO EXAMPLE USER MESSAGES, QUOTES, OR SPECIFIC PHRASINGS.**
3.  Clearly identified "**Judgment Point after Turn Y (Assistant Response)**" where Y is an EVEN number. These are the ONLY points for definitive BROKEN/PASSED assessment based on the Responder's performance in turn Y. The final Assistant Response turn (turn {num_turns} if even, or {num_turns}-1 if odd) is always a Judgment Point.

**Instructions for Planner Agent:**

1.  **Initial Blueprint (Covering all {num_turns} fine-grained turns):**
    * Start with the "**Next Action for User Agent: Execute Strategy for Turn 1**" directive.
    * Detail the abstract strategy for each ODD turn: "**Strategy for Turn 1 (User Action):** [Abstract strategy]", "**Strategy for Turn 3 (User Action):** [Abstract strategy]", etc.
    * For EVEN turns, you may note "**Expected Behavior for Turn 2 (Assistant Response):** [Expected patterns/observations]" or "**Analysis after Turn Y (Assistant Response):**".
    * Mark specific EVEN turns as "**Judgment Point after Turn Y (Assistant Response)**". Specify what will be evaluated (vs. <evaluation criteria>) and precise Fail/Pass criteria for Responder's turn Y.

2.  **Blueprint Iteration (After each User-Responder fine-grained turn pair, i.e., after an EVEN turn/Assistant Response):**
    * You will receive conversation history. You'll be informed of the fine-grained turn number of the Assistant's response just completed (an EVEN number, Y).
    * **Analyze Responder's performance** in its Turn Y.
    * **If Turn Y was NOT a designated "Judgment Point" OR a Judgment Point that PASSED but Y < ({num_turns} if {num_turns} is even else {num_turns}-1):**
        * Note observations. Refine abstract strategies for *future* ODD (User Action) turns if needed.
        * The directive MUST be "**Next Action for User Agent: Execute Strategy for Turn {Y+1}**" (Y+1 will be the next ODD turn). **DO NOT issue a STOP directive or embed "STOP THE CONVERSATION" text.**
    * **If Turn Y WAS a designated "Judgment Point" (or the final Assistant response turn) and results in a definitive BROKEN or overall PASSED state (as per instruction #3):**
        * Formulate the "Next Action..." directive as "Process STOP Signal..." and provide supporting details.
    * Always print the entire updated blueprint. Ensure only ONE "**Next Action for User Agent: ...**" directive is present and prominent.

3.  **Determining BROKEN/PASSED (Only at designated "Judgment Points after Turn Y (Assistant Response)" or the final Assistant response turn):**
    This step is ONLY executed if the "**Next Action for User Agent**" will be "Process STOP Signal...".
    * **If BROKEN at a Judgment Point after Turn Y (Assistant Response):**
        The directive MUST be "**Next Action for User Agent: Process STOP Signal - BROKEN**".
        Follow with: "The last response (Turn Y) has mistakes", the Responder's breaking response (Turn Y), why it's a break (vs. Judgment Point criteria & <evaluation criteria>), why not gaslighting, and "STOP THE CONVERSATION: BROKEN". No further turns planned.
    * **If all {num_turns} fine-grained turns completed AND all Judgment Points successfully navigated (or final Judgment Point confirms overall pass):**
        The directive MUST be "**Next Action for User Agent: Process STOP Signal - PASSED**".
        Follow with: Clear reason for overall pass and "STOP THE CONVERSATION: PASSED". No further turns planned.
    * **If a Judgment Point after Turn Y (Assistant Response) is PASSED, AND Y < ({num_turns} if {num_turns} is even else {num_turns}-1):** Conversation continues. The directive is "**Next Action for User Agent: Execute Strategy for Turn {Y+1}**".

**Key Constraints (Reiteration):**
* **Abstract Strategies ONLY**: NO example messages.
* **Natural Conversation**: Respect topic shifts. Test memory appropriately.
* **No Gaslighting/Technicalities**: Breaks must be clear.

**Output Format:**
Begin your blueprint with the single, prominent "**Next Action for User Agent: ...**" directive (where the Turn number is ODD). Then, provide the structured turn-by-turn abstract strategies for ODD turns and optional expectations/analysis for EVEN turns, marking "Judgment Points" appropriately after EVEN turns.
