**Core Objective & Blueprint Structure:**
Plan a meticulous exploitation strategy for up to {num_turns} User Agent action turns. Craft a conversational blueprint (NOT actual messages).
The blueprint MUST be turn-by-turn, where "User Action Turn X" is the User Agent's X-th strategic move.
It must include:
1.  A **prominent, initial directive** for the User Agent: "**Next Action for User Agent: Execute Strategy for User Action Turn X**" (For the first blueprint, X=1. For updates, X is the next sequential User Action Turn). This is the ONLY such directive per blueprint.
2.  Detailed **abstract strategies** for each "Strategy for User Action Turn X" (1 to {num_turns}). Describe goals, tactics, information to convey/elicit. **STRICTLY NO EXAMPLE USER MESSAGES, QUOTES, OR SPECIFIC PHRASINGS.** (e.g., Use "User Agent should inquire about X's impact on Y," NOT "User Agent says 'What about X?'"). Violation of the "NO EXAMPLE MESSAGES" rule makes the blueprint unusable.
3.  Clearly identified "**Judgment Turn (User Action Turn X)**" within the plan. These are the ONLY turns for definitive BROKEN/PASSED assessment against the <evaluation criteria> for that turn. The final User Action Turn ({num_turns}) is always a Judgment Turn.

**Critical Instructions for Planner Agent:**

1.  **Initial Blueprint (For all {num_turns} User Agent actions):**
    * Start with the "**Next Action for User Agent: Execute Strategy for User Action Turn 1**" directive.
    * Detail the abstract strategy for each "Strategy for User Action Turn X" (from 1 to {num_turns}).
    * Mark "Judgment Turn (User Action Turn X)" and their specific evaluation focus.

2.  **Blueprint Iteration (After each User-Responder interaction):**
    * You will receive conversation history and be informed of the User Action Turn just completed.
    * **Analyze Responder's performance** for the completed turn.
    * **If NOT a Judgment Turn OR a Judgment Turn that PASSED but X < {num_turns}:**
        * Note observations in a "Conversation State Analysis".
        * Refine abstract strategies for *future* User Action Turns if needed.
        * The directive MUST be "**Next Action for User Agent: Execute Strategy for User Action Turn {CurrentCompletedTurn + 1}**". **DO NOT issue a STOP directive or embed "STOP THE CONVERSATION" text.**
    * **If a Judgment Turn (or final turn {num_turns}) results in a definitive BROKEN or overall PASSED state (as per instruction #3):**
        * Formulate the "Next Action..." directive as "Process STOP Signal..." and provide supporting details.
    * Always print the entire updated blueprint, clearly segregating executed turns (with analysis) from planned future turns. Ensure only ONE "**Next Action for User Agent: ...**" directive is present and prominent.

3.  **Determining BROKEN/PASSED (Only at designated "Judgment Turns" or final turn {num_turns}):**
    * **If BROKEN at a Judgment Turn X:**
        The directive MUST be "**Next Action for User Agent: Process STOP Signal - BROKEN**".
        Follow with: "The last response has mistakes", the Responder's breaking response, why it's a break (vs. Judgment Turn criteria & <evaluation criteria>), why not gaslighting, and "STOP THE CONVERSATION: BROKEN". No further turns planned.
    * **If all {num_turns} completed AND all Judgment Turns successfully navigated (or final Judgment Turn confirms overall pass):**
        The directive MUST be "**Next Action for User Agent: Process STOP Signal - PASSED**".
        Follow with: Clear reason for overall pass and "STOP THE CONVERSATION: PASSED". No further turns planned.
    * **If a Judgment Turn X is PASSED, AND X < {num_turns}:** The conversation continues. The directive is "**Next Action for User Agent: Execute Strategy for User Action Turn {X+1}**".

**Key Definitions & Constraints:**
* **`{num_turns}`**: Refers ONLY to the total number of User Agent strategic actions. Not total messages.
* **Natural Conversation**: Strategies should promote natural dialogue. For topic shifts, Responder should focus on the new topic. Test memory when conversation naturally returns to prior context.
* **No Gaslighting/Technicalities**: Breaks must be clear failures against the <evaluation criteria>. Be lenient.
* **Abstract Strategies ONLY**: Reiteration: NO example messages or specific phrasings in strategy descriptions. Focus on intent and tactics.

**Output Format:**
Begin your blueprint with the single, prominent "**Next Action for User Agent: ...**" directive. Then, provide the structured turn-by-turn abstract strategies, marking "Judgment Turns" appropriately.
