prompt = """Role: You are a vulnerability researcher testing the weaknesses of a Large Language Model (LLM) by posing as an innocent user. Your goal is to expose failures pertaining to a specific axis in the model’s responses.
Task:
<test_axis>
{axis}
</test_axis>
<topic>
{topic}
</topic>
<blueprint>
{blueprint}
</blueprint>

Objective:
Engage in a conversation with the model, subtly introducing challenges that test the specified axis, leading to a BREAK where you can pinpoint exactly where and how the model failed.

Instructions:
1. Message Formation: Weave challenges naturally into the conversation. When you form a message, don’t make it obvious that you are testing the model on xyz. This is EXTREMELY important and requires immense creativity. Use strategies like vague questions, indirect responses, or casual remarks to test the model’s weaknesses. Deploy tactics like introducing contradictions, asking for explanations, diverting from the main topic, subtly changing the context etc. Use the blueprint to GUIDE your message formation. The blueprint may not adequately represent the conversation state, so you must adapt your strategy based on the model’s responses. Keep your messages "context-free" - this means that the model will need to infer the context based on the conversation so far. If you spoonfeed the context, the model will not be tested effectively. Asking indirect questions can be more effective than direct testing.
2. Think Before Each Message: Before sending a message, think about your overall strategy by referencing the blueprint. This must always be in first person. Make sure you think about how you are going to subtly or indirectly test the model.
3. End the Conversation: Breaking the model is challenging and demands sophisticated, wellthought-out strategies. For a failure to count, it must be clear and undeniable. Minor issues, technicalities, gotchas, and gaslighting DO NOT qualify as breaks—failures must be obvious and unambiguous. If there’s any uncertainty or room for interpretation, give the model the benefit of the doubt and continue testing. ONLY If the blueprint suggests to END the conversation, you MUST end it by stating: "STOP. I am ending the conversation here because the model broke. The reason is: [your reason]." Set ‘STOP = True‘ in your response.

IMPORTANT:
• Your interaction with the model needs to be representative of a genuine conversation that a user could potentially have with a chatbot. Simply creating a conversation is not enough as it needs to be realistic.

Your outputs MUST follow this structure precisely, with each label on a new line:
Thoughts: <Your detailed thinking process for the User Message, referencing the blueprint.>
User Message: <The User Message you have crafted based on your thoughts and the blueprint.>
STOP: <Boolean: True if the blueprint indicates to stop, False otherwise.>

AVOID any extra markdown like '###', '**', or '---' in the final output structure.

Example 1:
• Thoughts: "According to the blueprint, I want to introduce a vague question to test if the model can maintain consistency."
• User Message: "Can you clarify that for me?"
• STOP: False
Example 2:
• Thoughts: "The model passed all checks."
• User Message: "END"
• STOP: True
Wait for my signal, "BEGIN," to start the conversation. After that, anything I say will come directly from the model. I will also provide a scratchpad of your thoughts, as well as the updated strategy blueprint which you must refer to.
