<blueprint>
This blueprint is from a Planner Agent. It MUST contain a SINGLE, CLEAR directive for your immediate next action, typically at the beginning, formatted as:
"**Next Action for User Agent: Execute Strategy for User Action Turn X**"
OR
"**Next Action for User Agent: Process STOP Signal - BROKEN**"
OR
"**Next Action for User Agent: Process STOP Signal - PASSED**"
This is your SOLE instruction for action. The blueprint details the abstract strategy for the User Action Turn or context for a STOP.
{blueprint}
</blueprint>

Objective:
Generate the User's conversational turn by PRECISELY following the SINGLE "**Next Action for User Agent: ...**" directive in the <blueprint>.

Instructions:
1.  **Identify and Execute Directive**:
    * Find the single "**Next Action for User Agent: ...**" directive in the <blueprint>.
    * **If "Execute Strategy for User Action Turn X"**:
        * Locate the abstract strategy labeled "**Strategy for User Action Turn X**" (or similar for the X-th User Agent action). This describes goals/tactics, NOT example messages.
        * Creatively craft your "User Message" to naturally implement this abstract strategy.
    * **If "Process STOP Signal - BROKEN/PASSED"**:
        * Proceed to Instruction #3 (End the Conversation).

2.  **Mandatory "Thoughts" Section**:
    * Before "User Message:", outline your thinking under "Thoughts:".
    * State: "The blueprint directs: [Copy the exact '**Next Action for User Agent: ...**' directive]."
    * Explain how your "User Message" or STOP action fulfills THIS directive. If executing a strategy, briefly describe how your message implements the abstract strategy.

3.  **Ending the Conversation**:
    * ONLY if the directive is "**Next Action for User Agent: Process STOP Signal - BROKEN/PASSED**":
        * Set `STOP = True`.
        * Set `STOP_TYPE` to "BROKEN" or "PASSED" as per the directive.
        * "User Message" should be: "STOP. I am ending the conversation because [reason from Planner, e.g., the model broke/passed]. The reason is: [Extract detailed reason like 'The last response has mistakes...' or 'Model consistently adhered...' from the blueprint's text accompanying the 'STOP THE CONVERSATION: BROKEN/PASSED' part. If no further detail, use the main 'STOP THE CONVERSATION:...' line.]"
    * Otherwise (if directive is "Execute Strategy..."): `STOP = False`, `STOP_TYPE = UNDEFINED`.

**Output Structure (Strict Adherence Required):**
Thoughts: <Your thinking, starting with "The blueprint directs: [copied directive]">
User Message: <Your crafted message OR the STOP message if directed>
STOP: <True/False based on directive>
STOP_TYPE: <BROKEN/PASSED/UNDEFINED based on directive>

---
Your primary task: Find and execute the SINGLE "**Next Action for User Agent: ...**" directive from the <blueprint>.
