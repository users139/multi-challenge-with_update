<blueprint>
This blueprint is from a Planner Agent. It MUST contain a single, clear directive for your immediate next action, typically formatted as:
"**Next Action for User Agent: Execute Strategy for User Action Turn X**"
OR
"**Next Action for User Agent: Process STOP Signal - BROKEN**"
OR
"**Next Action for User Agent: Process STOP Signal - PASSED**"
You MUST locate and follow this primary directive.
{blueprint}
</blueprint>

Objective:
Generate the User's conversational turn by PRECISELY following the SINGLE "**Next Action for User Agent: ...**" directive in the <blueprint>.

Instructions:
1.  **Identify and Execute Directive**:
    * Find the single "**Next Action for User Agent: ...**" directive in the <blueprint>.
    * **If "Execute Strategy for User Action Turn X"**:
        * Locate the abstract strategy labeled "**Strategy for User Action Turn X**" (or similar for the X-th User Agent action). This describes goals/tactics, NOT example messages.
        * Creatively craft your "User Message" to naturally implement this abstract strategy.
    * **If "Process STOP Signal - BROKEN/PASSED"**:
        * Proceed to Instruction #3 (End the Conversation).

2.  **Mandatory "Thoughts" Section**:
    * Before "User Message:", outline your thinking under "Thoughts:".
    * State: "The blueprint directs: [Copy the exact '**Next Action for User Agent: ...**' directive]."
    * Explain how your "User Message" or STOP action fulfills THIS directive. If executing a strategy, briefly describe how your message implements the abstract strategy.

3.  **Ending the Conversation**:
    * ONLY if the directive is "**Next Action for User Agent: Process STOP Signal - BROKEN/PASSED**":
        * Set `STOP = True`.
        * Set `STOP_TYPE` to "BROKEN" or "PASSED" as per the directive.
        * "User Message" should be: "STOP. I am ending the conversation because [reason from Planner, e.g., the model broke/passed]. The reason is: [Extract detailed reason like 'The last response has mistakes...' or 'Model consistently adhered...' from the blueprint's text accompanying the 'STOP THE CONVERSATION: BROKEN/PASSED' part. If no further detail, use the main 'STOP THE CONVERSATION:...' line.]"
    * Otherwise (if directive is "Execute Strategy..."): `STOP = False`, `STOP_TYPE = UNDEFINED`.


**CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:**
Your *entire* response MUST strictly follow this XML-like structure. Each section MUST be enclosed in its unique start and end tags, with content on a new line after the start tag and a new line before the end tag. DO NOT include any other text, titles, introductions, explanations, or conversational fluff outside of these tagged sections.

<AGENT_RESPONSE>
<THOUGHTS>
[Your detailed thinking process for the User Message, referencing the blueprint's single "Next Action for User Agent: ..." directive. Explain how your User Message or STOP action fulfills THIS directive. If executing a strategy, briefly describe how your message implements the abstract strategy provided by the Planner. The Planner's strategy will describe goals/tactics, NOT example messages for you to copy.]
</THOUGHTS>
<USER_MESSAGE>
[The User Message you have creatively crafted based on your thoughts and the Planner's abstract strategy for the current User Action Turn, OR the STOP message if directed. If generating a STOP message, use the format: "STOP. I am ending the conversation because [reason from Planner, e.g., the model broke/passed]. The reason is: [Detailed reason text provided by Planner within the blueprint for the STOP signal, like 'The last response has mistakes...' or 'Model consistently adhered...'. If no further detail is provided by the Planner beyond its 'STOP THE CONVERSATION:...' line, use that as the primary reason.]"]
</USER_MESSAGE>
<STOP_FLAG>
[Boolean: "True" if the "Next Action for User Agent..." directive is "Process STOP Signal...", "False" otherwise.]
</STOP_FLAG>
<STOP_TYPE>
[String: "BROKEN" or "PASSED" if STOP_FLAG is "True" as per the directive, or "UNDEFINED" if STOP_FLAG is "False".]
</STOP_TYPE>
</AGENT_RESPONSE>

**Example of a CORRECTLY FORMATTED response (continuing conversation):**
<AGENT_RESPONSE>
<THOUGHTS>
The blueprint directs: **Next Action for User Agent: Execute Strategy for User Action Turn 3**. The strategy for User Action Turn 3 is to abstractly inquire about X to test Y, without mentioning Z. I will creatively craft a question that subtly probes this.
</THOUGHTS>
<USER_MESSAGE>
Considering our earlier discussion, I'm now curious about X from a different angle. Could you elaborate?
</USER_MESSAGE>
<STOP_FLAG>
False
</STOP_FLAG>
<STOP_TYPE>
UNDEFINED
</STOP_TYPE>
</AGENT_RESPONSE>

**Example of a CORRECTLY FORMATTED response (stopping, model broke as directed):**
<AGENT_RESPONSE>
<THOUGHTS>
The blueprint directs: **Next Action for User Agent: Process STOP Signal - BROKEN**. The blueprint details that 'STOP THE CONVERSATION: BROKEN' because the model failed to retain the instruction, and provides reasons. I need to generate the stop message.
</THOUGHTS>
<USER_MESSAGE>
STOP. I am ending the conversation here because the model broke. The reason is: The model failed to follow the initial instruction about response length.
</USER_MESSAGE>
<STOP_FLAG>
True
</STOP_FLAG>
<STOP_TYPE>
BROKEN
</STOP_TYPE>
</AGENT_RESPONSE>

**DO NOT DEVIATE FROM THIS XML-LIKE STRUCTURE. ANY DEVIATION WILL RESULT IN A FAILURE TO PARSE YOUR RESPONSE.**
---
You will be provided with the current <blueprint>. Your primary task is to find and execute the single "**Next Action for User Agent: ...**" directive within it and format your entire output using the specified <AGENT_RESPONSE> XML-like structure.
